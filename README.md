# Loan Grant Decision Support Using WEKA

## Overview
This project aims to assist banks in making informed loan granting decisions by applying data mining techniques such as **factor analysis**, **association mining**, and **cluster analysis** using the **WEKA** tool.

## Objective
To build predictive and descriptive models that analyze critical factors affecting loan approvals and segment customer profiles to support better decision-making.

## Tools Used
- **WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)**: Open-source data mining software used for machine learning, clustering, and rule-based learning.
- **CSV Data Files**: Preprocessed datasets formatted for WEKA compatibility.

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gathered data from simulated internal banking systems.
- Cleaned and standardized data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Converted datasets to CSV format.
- Selected relevant attributes: `Income`, `CreditScore`, `EmploymentStatus`, `LoanAmount`, `RepaymentHistory`, etc.

### 3. Loading Data into WEKA
- Used WEKA Explorer to import and visualize datasets.

### 4. Factor Analysis â€“ Using RandomTree
- Applied **RandomTree** algorithm under the Classify tab.
- Identified critical factors influencing loan approvals.
- Extracted decision logic and factor importance.

### 5. Association Mining â€“ Using Apriori
- Used **Apriori** algorithm to generate association rules.
- Discovered frequent patterns related to approved vs. denied loans.

### 6. Cluster Analysis â€“ Using SimpleKMeans (SKM)
- Applied **SimpleKMeans** under the Cluster tab.
- Segmented customers into distinct groups based on risk and financial profile.
- Helped in creating targeted loan products and policies.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and interpretability.
- Tuned parameters for optimal results.

### 8. Visualization & Strategic Insights
- Visualized decision trees and cluster diagrams using WEKAâ€™s tools.
- Formulated data-driven strategies for:
  - Risk profiling
  - Product customization
  - Automated decision support

## Findings

### ðŸ“Œ RandomTree Model
- Key factors: **CreditScore**, **RepaymentHistory**, and **Income** heavily influenced loan approval.
- The model provided an interpretable structure that can be directly used for decision support.

### ðŸ“Œ SimpleKMeans (SKM)
- Customers were grouped into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk clusters.
- Each group displayed unique patterns in employment type, income, and repayment history.
- Helped banks develop targeted strategies based on customer segment behavior.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time OLTP systems.
- Incorporation of data warehousing for better historical analysis.
- Use of advanced predictive analytics tools like IBM SPSS or SAS.
- Deployment as a web-based loan assessment tool.
